### About 
- This project introduces an interactive application tailored for managing a Coffee Shop using local devices.
- Noteworthy is the fact that this is our initial venture where we conceptualized, executed, and validated a solution employing various methods, principles, technical aspects, and tricks characteristic of a professional software engineer.
- Throughout this project, I focused on utilizing Three Layers Architecture for system management, incorporating SQL Server for database operations, and implementing design and functionality using c# and OOP principles.
