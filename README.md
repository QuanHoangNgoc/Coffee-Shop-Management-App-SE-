### About
- This project entails an interactive application tailored to facilitate Coffee Shop management on local devices.
- Notably, this project marks our first venture where we conceived, executed, and validated a solution employing various methods, principles, technical aspects, and tactics characteristic of a professional software engineer.
- Through this endeavor, I delved into the intricacies of Three Layers Architecture for system management, leveraging SQL Server for database functionality, and utilizing c# and OOP for design and implementation.
