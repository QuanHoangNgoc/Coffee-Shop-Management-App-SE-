### About 
- This is an interactive app designed to assist in managing a Coffee Shop on local devices.
- This project serves as an initial endeavor where we designed, implemented, and validated using professional software engineering methods, principles, techniques, and tricks.
- I gained insights into Three Layers Architecture for system management, utilized SQL Server for database operations, and employed c# and OOP for design and implementation.

### about 
- This is an interaction app that helps manage Coffee Shop on local devices.
- It is interesting to say that the first project we design, implement, and validate using an approach with some methods, principles, technicals, tricks, etc as a professional software engineer.
- I learn about Three Layers Architecture to manage the system, using SQL Server for database and c#, OOP to design and implement.
